      <description>A graph is a way to represent relationship between objects. For example we can represent friends in a class using a graph, we say that two students are connected if they are friends. We can represent every student in the class with a node and the friendship can be represented by drawing an edge between two nodes or students if they are friends.
From above example you can quickly realise different types of relations can easily be represented using graphs and thus graphs are the most important data-structures.</description>
